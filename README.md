[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f59a748d-ad94-4602-832a-d7c7425076e6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/nervous-ardinghelli-a06798/deploys)

Bundling of CSS/SCSS, fonts, images/favicons, and JavaScript is done via **Webpack**. Site generation is done **Jekyll**.

## Development
### Project Structure
In overall, everything in the `_src/` directory is processed by `webpack`. `_layouts/`, `_includes/`, `_data/`, `_posts/` is used by `Jekyll`.

The following is the step-by-step walk-through of the build process:
+ All the static assets (images, js, css etc.) are bundled using `ẁebpack` into the `assets/` directory.
+ `Jekyll` templates in `_src/template` are injected with the bundled asset links using `webpack`, then outputted into `_layouts/` directory.
+ `Jekyll` then uses `assets/` and the processed `_layouts/` to create the webpages. Note that there is a `Jekyll` post-write hook in `_plugins/` which moves the contents of the `_site/assets/favicons/` directory to the `_site/` root.

### Dependencies & Dev Environment
+ Make sure you have `node.js` installed. See [node.js snap](https://snapcraft.io/node) for Linux installation, or check out the official page for other installation methods.

+ `Yarn` is being used as the package manager for `Nnde.js` modules. Install dependencies with `yarn`:
```shell
cd <projectDir>
yarn install
```

+ Make sure you have `ruby`, `jekyll` and `bundler` installed. See [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

+ Install `Ruby` dependencies of the project:
```shell
cd <projectDir>
bundle install
```

### Linting
`stylelint` is used for `css` and `scss` linting, `eslint` is used for `javascript` linting.
```shell
cd <projectDir>
yarn lint:all
yarn lint:all:fix
```

### Testing
Generated html is validated and checked for broken links, non-https links, presence of favicons using the `html-proofer`, a `Ruby` package. The configuration options is specified in `Rakefile`. Building with `Jekyll` also enforces strict front matter.
```shell
cd <projectDir>
yarn test
```
