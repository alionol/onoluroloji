## Treatment of Premature Ejaculation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main principle in treatment is to identify the causes of premature ejaculation and to delay the reflex that causes it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible, couples should be treated together during the treatment of premature ejaculation. Searching into sexual harmony bears importance by listening to the couples individually at first and collectively later. Differences between couples should be examined in terms of how they conceive sexuality. Even if it takes 15 minutes for the male to ejaculate, the female may consider this as premature ejaculation due to her own conception on sexuality. Such subjective approaches should also be taken into consideration.

### Treatment of Premature Ejaculation Without Drugs;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anesthetic creams and sprays applied to the penis head as well as condoms reduce the sensitivity of penis. Furthermore, teaching patient the "Start-Stop" technique during sexual intercourse has a place in the treatment of premature ejaculation. During the treatment of premature ejaculation, the patient is also advised to perform Kegel Exercises, which strengthen the perineum muscles. The patient strengthens his muscles by performing these exercises several times a day and prolongs his reflex muscles. During the treatment of premature ejaculation, it is important to stop using alcohol, tobacco and also drugs that cause premature ejaculation.

### Drug Treatment in Premature Ejaculation;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drugs that increase serotonin secretion by the brain are used for treating premature ejaculation. These drugs prolong the reflex period up to 8 times. Drugs used for premature ejaculation should be used 3-4 hours prior to sexual intercourse. Dapoxetin, which is the latest generation of these newly developed drugs, can be taken 1 hour in prior. Nausea and vertigo are the side effects of these drugs. For this reason, it is beneficial to commence treatment at lower dosage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A painkiller drug is also used for treating premature ejaculation. It prolongs reflex period. Similarly, Tricyclic Antidepressants also prolong reflex period up to 5 times.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a principle, examination is initially made on the cause of premature ejaculation during its treatment. Appropriate treatment methods are identified and applied to the patient later on. Success rate is quite high in the treatment of premature ejaculation.
