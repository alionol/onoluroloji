In addition, they may also be transmitted through the needles that are not properly sterilized. They may be transmitted from the mother to the baby during the birth as well as through breast feeding. They can be transmitted by blood as well. The transmitting agents are bacteria, parasites, fungi and viruses. They can cause disease both in men and women. They can be dangerous in women, especially the pregnant ones. Most diseases are transmitted after sexual intercourse without condoms. (safe sex)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A physician can diagnose most of the sexually transmitted diseases with a simple examination and treat them easily.

### What are preventive methods?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condom use, circumcision, and vaccination against hepatitis A-B and human papillomavirus (HPV).

## Chlamydia

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chlamydia is among the most frequently sexually transmitted diseases. They are generally asymptomatic in women. When it gives symptoms, they may be in the form of change in the vaginal discharge, cystitis and light abdominal pain. Without treatment, it may cause pain in the pelvic region (lower abdominal zones) and during sexual contact. Light bleeding may be seen in between menstrual periods.

## Syphilis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syphilis is a bacterial disease characterized with pain in the genial zone and it is transmitted through sexually.

## Pubic Louse

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These lice are found in the pubic hair that grows in the skin above the public. They cause itchiness. These lice feed on human blood. Their treatment is simple.

## Genital Herpes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This virus is found in the male and female genital skin and cervix. It has two types. It is a chronic disease. As the disease is asymptomatic, most patients do not know that they are ill. Its first type is transmitted from person to person with direct contact, or vaginal, oral and anal sex. The other type can be transmitted with commonly used materials such as handkerchief. Its rare symptoms include vaginal discharge, tiny wounds in the cervix, painful urination and lassitude. Small, red and painful pustules may be seen in the genital region.

## Hepatitis B

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepatitis B is transmitted with the semen, blood, saliva or other body fluids of a virus infected person. It may also be transmitted through the needles that are not properly sterilized. It may further be transmitted through breastfeeding. The disease affects the liver and may create serious liver disorders, including cancer. For this reason, blood donors are always tested for Hepatitis B blood transfusion.

## AIDS (HIV)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a virus that attacks the immune system. It is progressive. It is transmitted via semen, blood, breast milk and vaginal discharge. It may be transmitted with vaginal, oral or anal sex or blood transfusion, breastfeeding or birth. The medical professionals who treat the patients with the AIDS must act with caution because the disease can be transmitted by blood. There is no cure for the disease; only its progress can be slowed down.

Foul-smelling vaginal discharge, pain during sexual intercourse and painful urination are among the symptoms of Trichomonas. The virus spread to men during sexual contact with a woman infected with the virus. It can be treated easily with drugs.

## Molluscum Contagiosum

Without treatment, they will disappear. But they may reappear 2 years later. These pustules are treated with chemicals, electrical current and freezing therapy. Some drugs may prove useful.

## Sarcoptes scabiei

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This parasite leaves its eggs inside the skin. It is characterized with excessive itchiness. It quickly spreads around the body. It can be transmitted via body contact or sexual contact. Excessive itching may result in inflammation. It may be seen in the genital areas, armpits, and many areas in the body.

If left untreated, they may give rise to serious disease findings in pelvic organs. In men, it may cause diseases in the urinary canal, testicles and prostate. In men, a dark, inflammatory discharge comes from the urinary canal. It causes pain in the testicles. First symptoms appear usually 2-10 days, and, in some cases, 30 days, after the sexual contact. Its treatment is simple as it is bacteria-induced.

## Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, trichomonas, sarcoptes scabiei and public louse are the diseases that can be treated. It must be noted that the other sexual partner should be treated as well. These diseases can be easily treated using antibiotics.
