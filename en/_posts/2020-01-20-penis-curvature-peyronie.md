&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 percent of men apply to physician due to penis curvature. Penis curvature is under two topics, which are congenital and later formed. Congenital penis curvatures may owe to Hypospadias disease. And the child's penis may be curved due a congenital anomaly. Curvatures occurring at later ages owe to Peyronie's Disease. This article will touch upon penis curvature due to Peyronie's Disease.

## What is Peyronie's Disease?

![Peyronie Nedir](/assets/img/peyronie.jpeg){:.size1}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peyronie's disease is a penis curvature that is not present at birth but that later occurred. Peyronie's disease is characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the firm shell, which surrounds the cavernous objects that provide penile erection. This scar tissue, meaning calcification, prevent the flow of blood inside the penis and therefore disrupts erection. Erection is painful.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curvature is in upwards direction during peyronie's disease. It causes problems during sexual intercourse. The appearance is bad. The penis is small depending on the degree of calcification. The more proximate location of calcification to the penis root, the higher erection problem occurs due to the obstruction of blood flow to the penis head.

## Cause of Peyronie's Disease

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact cause of peyronie's disease is unknown. Rumor is that it is caused by micro-traumas during sexual intercourse. But there is no evidenced information. Its occurrence rate is high after prostate cancer surgery. It is seen in middle-aged men.

## Diagnosis of Peyronie's Disease

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is total erection loss at advanced stages of peyronie's disease. Penis curvature can easily be diagnosed by a simple physical examination. Film and ultrasound may be required for determining the degree and extent of calcification. Penis curvature manifests itself with painful and insufficient erection.

## Drug Treatment in Peyronie's Disease

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was seen that drugs prescribed for years for the treatment of peyronie's disease aren't functional. Needle treatment applied inside the penis neither proved to have much benefit. Low dosage radiotherapy may only serve for reducing pain.

## Surgery for Peyronie's Disease

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 2 types of surgery for peyronie's disease. Patients, who have sufficient erection but encounter problems during sexual intercourse due to curvature, are applied penis curvature correction surgery. Penile prosthesis is installed in patients that have zero erection (impotence). This surgery corrects curvature and also, impotence is corrected by penile prosthesis (penile implant).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgical treatment should be performed 1-2 years following the commencement of the disease. If curvature isn't high, erectile problems are low and there is no pain, the patient is followed-up without treatment. The patient is operated if curvature disrupts sexual intercourse. The purpose of peyronie surgery is to correct the curvature in the penis and rendering the penis ready for sexual intercourse. This is both a functional and an esthetic operation. The principle is to correct the asymmetrical development in the lower and upper surface of the firm shell (tunica albuginea), which surrounds corpus cavernosum. For this, we either shorten the surface on the reverse side by suturing it, or we elongate the below surface by putting a graft on it. Meaning that surgery is performed according to two principles. But techniques that use grafts have side effects. Curvature may reoccur in the short-term. So it should only be applied for short penises. These operations are performed only if the patient's penis can achieve sufficient erection.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where penile erection is zero however, the final solution is the Penile Prosthesis surgery, meaning the installation of a penile implant. Penile Prosthesis procedure is more difficult in peyronie's disease patients due to calcification and therefore requires more experience. In a single phase during this procedure, the penis is flattened and also the erection problem is completely solved by installing penile prosthesis. You can find detailed information on penile prosthesis (penile implant) surgery from the Penile Prosthesis section of our website.
